# where(cond, a, b) is a pure memory-bound 3-in/1-out select: it streams a bool
# mask plus two data tensors and writes one. The XPU default CodeGenConfig
# (prefer_1d_tile=True, vectorization OPEN, unroll_num=0) generates a
# scalar-ish inner loop for the mixed-type tl.where (i1/i8 mask combined with
# f16/bf16/f32 data), which collapses large-shape bandwidth to ~250-300 GB/s.
# Measured on a single XPU (fresh compile, [10000, 65536], wall clock):

#   isCloseVectorization=True                  11.89ms  12.59ms  11.89ms

#   unroll_num=8/16 with vectorization OPEN    14.77ms  14.34ms  17.87ms
#
# The two knobs are only effective together: closing vectorization lets the
# backend emit contiguous block DMA for the mixed-type select (same recipe as
# masked_fill.py, since masked_fill == where(mask, value, inp)), and
# unroll_num=16 gives the DMA engine enough in-flight tiles to saturate HBM.
# Ablations that changed nothing (left out to keep the config minimal):
# max_tile_size 1024/2048/4096/8192, buffer_size_limit 2048/4096/8192,
# kunlunAutoGrid, isCloseDtypeConvert -- all reproduce 7.36ms, because with
# unrolled 1d tiles the effective tiling is decided by the unroll factor.
# Ablations that regressed: unroll_num=32 (10.32ms), isCloseInterleave=True
# (8.97ms).
#
# WARNING: do NOT use a non-power-of-two unroll_num here. unroll_num=12 emits a
# kernel that issues a garbage AXI read address and wedges the device (dmesg:
# KL_XID64_AXI_ADDR_ERROR / KL_XID_KERNEL_EXCEPTION, then
# kl3_wait_for_noc_idle() timeout), requiring a soft_reset to recover. This was
# reproduced twice on a healthy card, so treat it as a compiler-side
# constraint, not a transient hardware fault. 8/16/32 are all safe.
